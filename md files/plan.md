# GRABIT Backend Development Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive development plan for the GRABIT FastAPI backend, a production-ready YouTube video downloader with advanced features including real-time progress tracking, concurrent downloads, and high-quality video rendering.

## Project Overview

**GRABIT** is a FastAPI-based backend service that provides comprehensive YouTube video downloading capabilities using both `pytube` and `yt-dlp` libraries. The system supports single video downloads, playlist processing, batch operations, and real-time progress updates via WebSocket connections.

## Implementation Strategy

### Quality-Based Processing Strategy

The system uses a sophisticated quality-based routing strategy:

1. **Direct Download (≤720p)**: Use pytube for fast, direct downloads
2. **Render Required (>720p)**: Use yt-dlp + FFmpeg for high-quality merging
3. **Special Operations**: Always use yt-dlp for metadata, subtitles, thumbnails

### Error Isolation Architecture

Critical for production reliability:

1. **Individual Video Failures**: Don't affect playlist/batch operations
2. **Library Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation between pytube and yt-dlp
3. **Network Resilience**: Retry logic for transient failures
4. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of temporary files

### Concurrency Management

Designed for multi-user environments:

1. **Semaphore-based Limiting**: Control concurrent downloads per user
2. **Async Task Management**: Non-blocking operations with task tracking
3. **WebSocket Scaling**: Efficient message broadcasting to subscribers
4. **Resource Pooling**: Shared FFmpeg and download resources

### Security Considerations

Production security measures:

1. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive URL and parameter validation
2. **Resource Limits**: File size, concurrent downloads, rate limiting
